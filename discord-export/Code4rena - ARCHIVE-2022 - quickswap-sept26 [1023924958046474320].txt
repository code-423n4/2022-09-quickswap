Uniswap V3?

{Reactions}
👍 

[09/26/2022 23:44] carrotsmuggler
is there any benefit to using create2 to create pool contracts over the normal method that uniswapv2 uses?


[09/27/2022 00:22] neko_nyaa
Security + gas reasons
- Gas because hashing is much cheaper than storage read
- Security because you can send tokens to the pair without it being created

{Reactions}
👍 

[09/27/2022 00:25] carrotsmuggler
i dont understand the gas savings? if i just deploy with `new AlgebraPool()` how is that using extra storage reads compared to `new AlgebraPool(salt:...)`


[09/27/2022 00:25] carrotsmuggler
ah nevermind for future access i get it


[09/27/2022 00:26] carrotsmuggler
thanks!


[09/27/2022 00:27] neko_nyaa
For uniswap v2, the function `getPair` for getting pair addresses is a pure function

V2 peripheries (router and such) uses that a lot, so the gas-saving is quite meaningful

Quickswap uses algebra 
The audit page says quickswap and stellaswap


[09/27/2022 01:42] tofunmi
Is this the entire algebra codebase,  or new 
If new,  is it a new Oracle system or what ??
What is changing this time , new amm design or what @qcrsh @Vladyan18


[09/27/2022 01:44] tofunmi
Or more like new change to algebra and it is affecting quickswap and stellaswap

in left hand side, the higher the volatility, the larger the fee multiplier. In the right hand side, the more an asset pair is used (intensity), the higher the total fee. The low and high of the functions are capped and the growth of each side looks like a sigmoid, wikipedia has a good article on that.

When comparing the sizes of two addresses, tokenA < tokenB, what is it based on? The hexadecimal values, or something else? If it's based on hexadecimal value, is there any tool we can use to determine that? Thanks


[09/27/2022 23:01] tofunmi
The hex value of course,  For determining the order in the mapping I guess
Maths doesn't lie
Eg Usdc address converted to converted to decimal is 9175510.......5704 
Addresses are just values too right ??

ah is it ? ahahaha


[09/28/2022 12:28] jeiwan
Even the tests are copy pasted


[09/28/2022 12:29] jeiwan
Most of the code is Uni v3 written in a different way 😂  As if they tried to write Uni v3 without writing Uni v3


[09/28/2022 12:31] jeiwan
And a lot of renames 😂  The same stuff but named differently, e.g. TickBitmap became TickTable but it does the exactly same thing.

{Reactions}

[09/28/2022 12:37] jeiwan
I don't know what to audit here. They took Uniswap V3, renamed all the functions, rewritten them, copy-pasted the entire test suits (including Echidna tests) so it keeps working. The only authentic thing seems to be the AdaptiveFee library and the DataStorage stuff (but maybe they're also copied from somewhere 🤷‍♂️)

[09/28/2022 21:11] ladboy233
what is this function doing?


[09/28/2022 21:11] ladboy233
what does this function suppose to do?


[09/28/2022 21:12] b353n
Callback to receiver. If is contract you can do many thinks.


[09/28/2022 21:19] haruxe
it allows contracts to be able to react to the event


[09/28/2022 21:19] haruxe
however it wishes to handle it


[09/28/2022 21:22] trustminimised
The intention in context seems to be to implement the actual transfer of tokens in the swap, as the contract immediately `require`s that the balances have changed by the corresponding amounts in `swap`.
There are similar callbacks elsewhere in `AlgebraPool`. The use of callbacks like this seems to be a uniswap-ism from V3.

Exactly, also the code was audited by 3 auditing companies…

I find because of the Uniswap elements it's taken me a lot longer to get my head around the codebase. But also studying Uniswap is on my learning list and I'll keep coming back to this codebase after the audit as a template for related implementations.
